# KoalaCloak (Previously known as ANZMobilePayRootDetectionBypass) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbombnz/KoalaCloak.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbombnz/KoalaCloak)
An Xposed Module for Android that allows Australian users to use their modified devices with popular banking and financial applications such as ANZ Mobile Pay, ANZ Shield and Westpac Mobile Banking. With this enabled, you can have Tap'n'Pay on rooted and non-supported devices.

NAB is currently being looked into but is much more sophisticated than the other banking and financial applications. The problem seems to be in the native library which is pass the limits of the Xposed Framework.

CUA redi2PAY and People's Choice redi2PAY have been removed due to lack of demand. If you would like these be added in the xposed module, please contact me via Email.

For more general information about the module please visit the [XDA thread link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-anz-mobile-pay-root-detection-t3340845).

## Developer Notice
The source code might be poorly designed in some parts of the code, especially due to constant updating and fast addition of new features over the last few weeks. In the future, I plan to apply actual software design standards, make the source code easier to read and understand, clean up commenting and reduce duplicated code. All this will be done when I have time though, possibly in the university breaks and holiday periods.
