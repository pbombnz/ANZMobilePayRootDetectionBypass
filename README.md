## Developer Notice
The source code might be poorly designed in some parts of the code, especially due to constant updating and fast addition of new features over the last few weeks. In the future, I plan to apply actual software design standards, make the source code easier to read and understand, clean up commenting and reduce duplicated code. All this will be done when I have time though, possibly in the university breaks and holiday periods.
